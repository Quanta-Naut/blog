Blast Off! Welcome to My Journey of Rockets and Code
![[img1.png]]
Introduction:
Welcome to my blog! I’m thrilled to share my projects, passion, and progress in the exciting worlds of rocketry and programming. This space will be a blend of technical insights, creative experiments, and updates on my journey to build and launch rockets while sharpening my coding skills.
What to Expect:

Rocketry Adventures: I am actively working on my rocket that is set to reach an apogee of 1km and hopefully be recovered without any damage. Here I will be sharing my updates and build process, and many more to come.
Programming Projects: I am very much interested in programming, more like interested in creating simulation using programming. I will be sharing detailed posts on the projects I make here. My LinkedIn for the projects I worked on.
Progress Updates: Stay tuned for real-time updates on my experiments and achievements, and perhaps a few lessons learned along the way.

Why This Blog:
I made this blog site to document and express myself. Here I will share all my updates that will be useful for some one or the other. And also I will have it as my memory so that I can have fun time reading all the work I did, while reading it in the future."><meta name=author content="Tarun"><link rel=canonical href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/posts/my-first-blog/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d72444526d7ecbdb0015438a7fa89054a658bf759d0542e2e5df81ce94b493ee.css integrity="sha256-1yREUm1+y9sAFUOKf6iQVKZYv3WdBULi5d+BzpS0k+4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://quanta-naut.github.io/posts/my-first-blog/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://quanta-naut.github.io/posts/my-first-blog/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="QuantaQuill"><meta property="og:title" content="My First Blog!!!"><meta property="og:description" content="Title: Blast Off!
