## **Title:**
Blast Off! Welcome to My Journey of Rockets and Code

## **Introduction:**
Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m thrilled to share my projects, passion, and progress in the exciting worlds of rocketry and programming. This space will be a blend of technical insights, creative experiments, and updates on my journey to build and launch rockets while sharpening my coding skills.

## **What to Expect:**
* **Rocketry Adventures:** I am actively working on my rocket that is set to reach an apogee of 1km and hopefully be recovered without any damage. Here I will be sharing my updates and build process, and many more to come.
* **Programming Projects:** I am very much interested in programming, more like interested in creating simulation using programming. I will be sharing detailed posts on the projects I make here. [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarun-kumar-s-676a74267/") for the projects I worked on.
* **Progress Updates:** Stay tuned for real-time updates on my experiments and achievements, and perhaps a few lessons learned along the way.

## **Why This Blog:**
I made this blog site to document and express myself. Here I will share all my updates that will be useful for some one or the other. And also I will have it as my memory so that I can have fun time reading all the work I did, while reading it in the future.
